# Responsive Portfolio Website

Welcome to the README for the Responsive Portfolio Website project! This project is aimed at creating a visually appealing and user-friendly portfolio website that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across devices.

## Overview

The Responsive Portfolio Website project focuses on implementing responsive design principles to ensure that the website looks and functions well on devices of all sizes, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Key features of this project include:

- **Fluid Layout:** The website layout adjusts dynamically based on the screen size, utilizing percentage-based widths and flexible containers to maintain proportionality.

- **Mobile-First Approach:** The website is designed with a mobile-first mindset, ensuring that it is functional and visually appealing on small screens before progressively enhancing the layout for larger devices.

- **Navigation Menu:** A responsive navigation menu is implemented to facilitate easy navigation on mobile devices, typically through a collapsible menu (hamburger menu) or other mobile-friendly navigation patterns.

- **Image Optimization:** Images are optimized for fast loading times on mobile devices without compromising quality, utilizing techniques such as responsive images and lazy loading.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages the following technologies and tools:

- HTML5 and CSS3 for markup and styling
